# Greed

"The object of Greed is to erase as much of the screen as possible by moving around in a
grid of numbers. To move your cursor, simply use the wasdqezc keys. Your location is 
signified by the @ symbol.

When you move in a direction, you erase N number of grid squares in that direction, N
being the first number in that direction. Your score reflects the total number of squares
eaten."
